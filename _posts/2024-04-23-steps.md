# Steps for creation of and deploy of a Blog Post 


Looking to share your thoughts, experiences, or expertise through a blog? With Jekyll and GitHub Pages, you can effortlessly create and publish posts without managing servers or databases. Let's walk through creating and publishing your first post using these tools.

##  Setting Up Your Jekyll Site

First, set up your Jekyll site:

1. Install Ruby and RubyGems: Ensure Ruby and RubyGems are installed on your computer.
2. Install Jekyll Gem: Run gem install jekyll to install the Jekyll gem.
3. Create a Jekyll Site: Use jekyll new your-site-name to create a new Jekyll site.
4. Navigate to Site: Go to your site's directory (cd your-site-name).
5. Start Server: Run bundle exec jekyll serve to start the local server.

Your site is now live locally at http://localhost:4000.

## Step 2: Crafting Your First Post

Let's create your debut post:

1. Access Posts Folder: Navigate to the _posts folder in your site's directory.
2. Create Markdown File: Craft a Markdown file with the format YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-your-post.md (e.g., 2024-04-23-my-first-post.md).
3. Open in Editor: Edit the Markdown file with your preferred text editor.

## Step 3: Writing Your Content

In the Markdown file, unleash your creativity using Markdown syntax. Markdown is simple yet powerful for formatting text without HTML tags. Here's a basic example:

Code
<br>
---
<br>
layout: post
<br>
title: My First Blog Post
<br>
---
<br>

## Step 4: Adding Metadata

Add YAML front matter between triple dashes at the file's top. Front matter includes metadata like layout, title, date, and author. Example:

Code
<br>
---
<br>
layout: post
<br>
title: My First Blog Post
<br>
date: 2024-04-23
<br>
author: Your Name
<br>
---
<br>

## Step 5: Preview Locally

Before going live, preview your post locally with bundle exec jekyll serve. Visit http://localhost:4000 to see your changes.

## Step 6: Publishing on GitHub

Ready to share? Follow these steps:

1. Stage Changes: Use git add . to stage your changes.
2. Commit: Commit with a descriptive message: git commit -m "Add my first blog post".
3. Push: Push changes to your GitHub repository's master branch: git push origin master.
